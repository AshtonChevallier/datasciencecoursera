CodeBook for TidyData from Samsung Accelrometer dataset.

Activity - Data observation point on whether the parituclar subject was:
    LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    
Subject - Data observation point on the particular subject at hand, subjects are labeled #1:30.

Observation Datapoints are essentially a combination of 2 sets of observation types:

A:) These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

B:) The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

In the tidyMeans data set, the same observational details apply, but each row contains the AVERAGE of all points for a given 
Activity and Subject.
